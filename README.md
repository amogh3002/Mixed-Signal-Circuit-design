DESIGN OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SAMPLE AND HOLD ARCHITECTURES IN 180nm TECHNOLOGY


A Sample and Hold Circuit, sometimes represented as S/H Circuit or S&H Circuit, is usually used with an Analog to Digital Converter to sample the input analog signal and hold the sampled signal.In the S/H Circuit, the analog signal is sampled for a short interval of time, usually in the range of 10 µS to 1 µS.After this, the sampled value is hold until the arrival of next input signal to be sampled.It forms the interface between analog world and the signal processing system- High precision and speed is required.Sampling circuits samples an analog signal and stores the value in a memory element until next sampling instant.Operation is periodic and it is stored in the form of voltage in capacitor.

Types of Sample and Hold architectures:

1.Open loop architecture
2.Closed loop architecture
3.Closed loop with pedestal error cancellation
4.Switched capacitor architecture
5.Current mode architecture
